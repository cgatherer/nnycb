Visual Regression Testing using BackstopJS

For now, against pantheon

config files:
shared/live-links.json defines pages to test
shared/viewports.js defines viewports/breakpoints
dev.js sets dev to test against ptheon multidev env as reference
local.js sets local to test against dev env as reference
ptheon.js sets local to test against ptheon multidev env as reference

run like:

lando npm run reference-dev # gets reference bitmaps from dev env
lando npm run test-dev # gets test bitmaps from ptheon env
. openreport # launch report in browser
